# 🚀 My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio. This project is a digital reflection of my journey as a 2nd-year Information Technology student at RMIT, a web developer, and a long-distance runner.

It’s designed to be fast, responsive, and minimalist—built with the same discipline I bring to a 42km marathon.

  🛠️ Tech Stack
Framework: React

Language: TypeScript (for type safety and cleaner code)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Deployment: Not Yet

Icons: Lucide React / FontAwesome

 ## ✨ Key Features
Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Project Gallery: Showcasing my work, including accessibility-focused projects and hackathon entries.

Performance: Optimized for fast loading speeds and smooth transitions.

Dark/Light Mode: (Optional—if you've implemented it).

##  🏃‍♂️ About Me
Beyond the code, I am a dedicated runner. I believe the persistence required for long-distance running translates directly into solving complex bugs and learning new frameworks. Whether I'm on the track or at my keyboard, I'm always pushing for the next milestone.
